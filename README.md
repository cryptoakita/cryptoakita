- 👋 Hi, I’m @cryptoakita. I began my crypto journey in the early 2021, first started with trading and then moved onto defi but now,
- 👀 I am interested in learning more about what the codes actually mean and eventually start coding myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently using many of the applications built on the ethereum and polygon network and I am simply amazed of the opportunities it presents.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on where I can go to begin learning about coding (without having to watch a bunch of hyped up youtube with 1 minute long intros, stupid thumbnail picture of their stupid face with their mouth opened.)
- 📫 How to reach me cryptoakita123@gmail.com
